There are several rescaling techniques, but one of the simplest is called min-max scaling. Min-max scaling uses the minimum and maximum values of a feature to rescale values to within a range. \n","The Scikit-learn 'MinMaxScaler' offers two options to rescale a feature. One option is to use fit to calculate the minimum and maximum values of the feature, then use transform to rescale the feature. The second option is to use 'fit_transform()' to do both operations at once. There is no mathematical difference between the two options, but it may sometimes be useful to perform the functions separately on different data. Following is an example with code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1KgHauN7xfHB"},"source":["Let's start by importing necessary libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1657870390649,"user":{"displayName":"Govind Bhat","userId":"11500974554390449652"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"cis-lsFvB7Cc"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Load Libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn import preprocessing\n","import random\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FSfDrZmUxLJB"},"source":["Let's create a randomized dataset called income with the help of random Library"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":588,"status":"ok","timestamp":1657214969089,"user":{"displayName":"Govind Bhat","userId":"11500974554390449652"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"f8L3GnwTxc5l","outputId":"c2f8f5a5-4485-4170-ab3f-00e4a36fb670"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Creating a dataset\n","sales = np.array([[-200],[-10],[50],[1000],[15],[20],[30],[50],[100],[200],[10000],[-12000],[150000],[160000]])\n","\n","#for x in range(50):\n","# sales.append(random.randint(-100000000,1000000000))\n","print(sales)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0_ykCvhDz2vb"},"source":["Now let's create a Scaler and scale the sales"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":621},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":370,"status":"error","timestamp":1657204749681,"user":{"displayName":"Govind Bhat","userId":"11500974554390449652"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"V3bVGzSOxxm0","outputId":"270a501b-cea3-4262-fa2c-add1100655b2"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a scaler\n","minmax_scale = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))\n","\n","#Scale feature\n","scaled_sales = minmax_scale.fit_transform(sales)\n","\n","#Show feature\n","scaled_sales"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YHcQTIGsjb5T"},"source":["### Standardizing features\n","The scaling of features to be roughly standard and normally distributed is a common substitute for the min-max scaling.
